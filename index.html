          <h3>This is a rather heady talk</h3>
          <p>Some things I hope you'll come away with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>New words, and new ideas about familiar words</li>
            <li>New metaphors for thinking about Drupal, but systems in general</li>
            <li>A belief that Drupal's complexity can be mitigated</li>
            <li>That doing so is <em>paramount</em> to the health of the project</li>
            <li>And that reducing complexity is Drupal's highest calling</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>So this talk is a little out there. But I'm really glad y'all are here. In all the Drupal talks I've given over the years, i think this is far and away the most important one.</li>
              <li>(run through the items)</li>
              <li>Honestly, this talk is about what's killing Drupal. Prominent community members have left because of the basic issues that we'll be discussing.</li>
              <li>In other words, this is my take on what's killing Drupal.</li>

          <p>Much of this talk is proudly purloined from Rich Hickey's <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple Made Easy</a></p>
          <p><small>(If you haven't seen it, you should fix that)</small></p>
          <aside class="notes">
          <p>a ton of this talk is lifted pretty directly from a fantastic talk given by Rich Hickey, the creator of Clojure, at Strange Loop in 2011. (but hey, it's ok, because i'm acknowledging it!)</p>
          <p>While i did come up with the general idea for this talk before having seen Rich Hickey's talk, that talk gave fundamental shape and form to this one</p>
          <p>but i'm going to go a different place than he did with his talk; he was focused on making an argument for functional programming. i think there's value there, and you should watch the talk, but such an argument isn't really useful for most people, who can't just switch at the drop of a hat.</p>
          <p>i think the basic premises he outlines there are incredibly powerful. in particular, he gives us some words - both new ones, and new concepts for familiar ones - in his talk. hat's where i want to start.</p>

            <p>So, in a slide that is almost exactly the same as the one from his talk, let's start by looking at the words 'simple' and 'easy'.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>we use these words a lot. but we'd benefit from using them more precisely. one of the great ways to do that is to look at a word's history - its etymology.</li>
              <li>Simple, from simplus, or simplex. it quite literally means "one fold or braid." and if you picture a single braid, that just...straight. if that doesn't make sense, then think about the more familiar word "duplex."</li>
              <li>The opposite of this is complex, as in braided together. this is a key concept in both my talk, and in Rich Hickey's - understanding what this folding looks like, and the problems with it.</li>
              <li>Easy is a little trickier to get something good from. <em>ese</em> from Middle English, back through to the Old French <em>aise</em>. There are a lot of senses for these words, but the most relevant one here is the idea of a "lack of effort." </li>
              <li>now, Rich found another "speculative" linkage, back to the Latin adjacens (root of adjacent). i couldn't find that linkage myself, but it serves the talk well, so i'm stealing that too. *CLICK*</li>
              <li>this is really useful because the idea of "lying near" captures the proximity sense of "lack of effort", and that helps with the overall metaphor i'm trying to build in your mind right now.</li>
            </ul>

            <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>remember our etymology: "to lie near". near...what? well, an agent. a person. so...me!</li>
              <li>'ease' is inherently subjective. and we are OBSESSED with it - as software engineers, and maybe even as humans in general.</li>

            <h3>Easy: "Near, Effortless"</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>In our tooling:
              <ul>
                <li>WYSIWYG</li>
                <li>Devel module</li>

              <li>Close to our existing skills and knowledge</li>
              <li>Minimal effort required for understanding/mastery</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <ul>
                <li>WYSIWYG - it's "near" to the editors' understanding, mental model of configuring digital text (is it still?)</li>
                <li>package managers: abstract the task of collecting and installing dependencies (for your system, app, whatever)</li>
                <li>Devel module: here, "ease" is all about locating tools in a single place</li>
              </ul>
              <p>ultimately we're talking about a specific group of people, and the knowledge/experience we <em>think</em> they have. and we want to minimize the effort for them to pick up a new thing.</p>
              <p>this is FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from talking about the intrinsic simplicity of a thing. (it's also one way to build an island, btw)</p>
              <p>playing the violin is not EASY for me, but it may be EASY for many of you. or, one better - reading Braille.</p>

              <li>i often find myself comparing the search for simplicity as being like a pig sniffing out truffles: reasoning can help me get part of the way there, but at a certain point, i'm just following instincts; there's a feeling i get when my mind latches on to something unentangled, something truly simple.</li>

              <li>however, it's perfectly possible for us to have "more than oneness" without increasing complexity</li>
              <li>the key here is that in each of these examples, adding more of them does not increase intrinsic complexity.</li>
              <li>this is because each of these things are increasing in cardinality - the count of a thing, not the number of types of things.</li>

            <p>OK, just a little bit more of definitions. first, a metaphor</p>
            <p>I really like the braiding idea as a way of describing complexity. By twisting separate things together, we create artfiacts in which it is impossible to deal separately with the individual pieces.</p>
            <p>Problem with the metaphor is that in a braid, we can still see individual strands. In a complex system, we typically cannot identify the original constituent pieces.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Reasoning is the chief thing that matters when it comes to working with a system. If we can't reason about it, we can accomplish only the most rudimentary of tasks.</li>
                <li>The complexity of a system - the number of interleaved, independent parts - is really what determines our ability to reason about a system. (use hawk story here; maybe find another)</li>
                <li>"exceeds" is a massive understatement. our ability to create complexity is unbounded. our ability to reason about it is VERY bounded. diffrential human capabilities in reasoning are insignificant in the face of the complexity we can create</li>
                <li>Bill, Jamal, Pooja</li>
                <li>there is a rather obvious conclusion here: if you don't build for simplicity, your system will not scale well into complex requirements/over time, and you will leave the humans that use it grasping at straws</li>
                <li>there's also an axiom to be had: braiding is a good metaphor, but a more practical question to ask yourself is, "how will this change i make impact peoples' ability to reason about the system?"</li>

            <h3>Simple and Easy are both important (and difficult)</h3>
            <p>Easy gets the attention by default. Simple requires conscious effort.</p><br/>
            <p><em>Crucial question: </em>is this acceptable complexity?</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              <ul>
                <li>this talk is worth giving because our collective tendency - especially in Drupal - is to tend towards ease. </li>
                <li>Dijkstra again: "Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better."</li>
                <li>nevertheless, both of them are important. you can build the most elegant, simple system ever, but that does not guarantee it will be easy - and if nobody can get over the hump of learning it, does your system matter?</li>
                <li>this is why we must ask the crucial question - whether the complexity is acceptable.</li>
                <li>because complexity, once introduced, never goes away, whereas easy fades. complexity is carried into EVERY system that builds on yours. don't forget, it's intrinsic!</li>
                <li>it's just that certain kinds of complexity may not matter for the use case. that - and that alone - should be the basis of the answer to acceptability question.</li>

              <li>the previous slide's point: there comes a point at which software exceeds our capacity to reason about it</li>

            <!--<p>Better quote: Programming languages on the whole are very much more complicated than they used to be: object orientation, inheritance, and other features are still not really being thought through from the point of view of a coherent and scientifically well-based discipline or a theory of correctness. My original postulate, which I have been pursuing as a scientist all my life, is that one uses the criteria of correctness as a means of converging on a decent programming language design—one which doesn’t set traps for its users, and ones in which the different components of the program correspond clearly to different components of its specification, so you can reason compositionally about it.</p>-->

            <ul>
              <li>ok, let's get a little more concrete, and talk about how all this actually applies to Drupal.</li>
              <li>this is the part where my talk really diverges from Rich Hickey's - he's essentially making an argument for functional programming and immutable state. while he's not incorrect, his perspective is too purist to be <em>useful</em> for something like Drupal.</li>
              <li>honestly, this is a little hard to do. <em>so</em> much of Drupal is so complected together that picking out particular points is tricky. in his talk, Rich Hickey focuses on things like language aspects - say, syntax and parens - but we have few such luxuries.</li>
              <li>but this goes back to the earlier question: what complexity is acceptable, and why?</li>
              <li>i'd love folks to approach me later with (fairly clean, preferably) examples of how Drupal is complected. the better these examples are, the more we can build a good set of examples, the easier it will be for people to latch on to these concepts.</li>
